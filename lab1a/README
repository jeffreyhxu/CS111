Contained in this tarball are lab1a.c, Makefile, and README.

lab1a.c is the source code for a program that reads input from the keyboard and
echoes it back to the terminal. With the --shell argument, it forks to open a
shell in a new process and uses pipes to transfer input from the keyboard to the
shell and output from the shell back to the terminal.

Makefile supports the default target, which builds the lab1a executable, clean,
which removes the tarball and the executable, and dist, which builds the
tarball.

README describes the contents of the tarball and gives information on the
sources used to research topics I was unsure about.

Aside from the Open Group Base Specifications
(http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/nframe.html), which I used for
information on all the system calls used, I used Google to find an answer on
askubuntu (http://askubuntu.com/questions/201303/what-is-a-defunct-process-and-w
hy-doesnt-it-get-killed) to figure out what it meant when an early version of
lab1a created a defunct shell in its child process.
