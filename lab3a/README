The tarball contains lab3a.c, Makefile, and README.

lab3a.c is the source code for a program that reads and analyzes a provided file
system image, producing a CSV file that describes the superblock, block groups,
free blocks, free inodes, inodes, directory entries, and indirect blocks.

Makefile supports the default target, dist, and clean. The default target
compiles lab3a.c into the program lab3a. dist creates the tarball. clean deletes
all programs and output generated by Makefile, specifically lab3a and the
tarball.

README describes the files in the tarball.
