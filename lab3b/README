The tarball contains lab3b.cpp, Makefile, and README.

lab3b.cpp is the C++ source file for a program that analyzes a file system
summary like the one generated by lab3a and reports all discovered
inconsistencies.

Makefile supports the default target, dist, and clean. The default target builds
lab3b from lab3b.cpp. dist builds the tarball. clean removes all files created
by the Makefile, namely, the executable and the tarball.

README describes the contents of the tarball.
