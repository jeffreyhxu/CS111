This tarball includes selfie.png, ifconfig.png, scp.png,
compilation_and_execution.png, git_clone.png, and README.

selfie.png is a selfie of me holding my assembled and plugged-in Edison.

ifconfig.png is a screenshot from a USB terminal command session showing the IP
and MAC addresses of the Edison. This is not actually from the session in which
I set up the Wi-Fi access; that session was on a Windows computer. To avoid
having to transfer files and for consistency, I replicated the ifconfig command
on a Ubuntu VM.

scp.png is a screenshot from a local session in which I used scp to copy a hello
world program from the VM to the Edison. Note that there is no message asking
about creating a trusted connection because I accidentally copied the wrong file
over on my first attempt, so this is after the trusted connection was
established. In addition, the ssh keys were set up in a previous session.

compilation_and_execution.png is a screenshot from a Wi-Fi SSH session in which
I built and ran the hello world program. Again, because SSH keys were set up
previously, no login was required.

git_clone.png is a screenshot from a Wi-Fi SSH session in which my CS111 github
repository was cloned onto the Edison. Unfortunately, I closed out of the
terminal before reading that the screenshot should also contain the installation
of git, so I cleared the terminal to show only the git clone command and
subsequent local directory.

README describes the files in the tarball and provides the serial number and MAC
address of my Edison.

Serial number:
Edison module:   FZEDA 652D 02BU7 501
Expansion board: FZER  652B 01V9H 500

MAC address: 90:b6:86:05:d4:ba
