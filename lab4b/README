The tarball contains lab4b.c, Makefile, and README.

lab4b.c is the source file for an embedded application for an Intel Edison that
regularly reports the temperature detected by the temperature sensor. It takes
options to choose the temperature scale, frequency of samples, and log file.
While running, it takes commands to adjust temperature scale, adjust frequency
of samples, suspend sampling, continue sampling, and stop the program. In
addition, pressing the button also stops the program.

Makefile supports the default target, check, clean, and dist. The default target
builds lab4b. If it is run on anything other than an Edison, it will pass the
-DDUMMY flag to gcc, causing lab4b to be built with dummy implementations of the
functions that read from the sensors. check runs a quick smoke test to make sure
lab4b correctly reports a time and a temperature, as well as correctly responds
to the OFF command, even after a long string of other commands. clean deletes
all files created by the Makefile, namely lab4b and the tarball. It won't delete
any log files created by the user. dist creates the tarball.

README contains descriptions of the included files.
