The tarball contains lab4c_tcp.c, lab4c_tls.c, Makefile, and README.

lab4c_tcp.c is the source code for a program based on the one created in lab 4b.
It performs the same functions and accepts the same options, with the addition
of connecting to a server, using the --host= option to determine host name,
defaulting to lever.cs.ucla.edu, --id= to determine ID number, and a command
line argument to determine port number, defaulting to 18000.

lab4c_tls.c is similar, but uses OpenSSL to establish a SSL/TLS encryption
session with the server. It accepts the same options, but its port number
defaults to 19000.

Makefile supports the default target, clean, and dist. The default target builds
lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls, passing a flag to implement dummy functions if not
built on an Edison. clean deletes both executables and the tarball to return to
freshly untarred state. dist builds the tarball.

README describes the files contained in the tarball.
